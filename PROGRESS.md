# Progress

One phase per session, fresh context. This file plus `ARCHITECTURE.md` is how
state moves between sessions. Update both at the end of every phase.

## Phase 0 -- Scaffold and verification harness (done)

### Built

- Vite + TypeScript (strict, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) + Three.js WebGL2. One lit cube whose colour is
  derived from the world seed, so seed plumbing is verifiable by eye.
- `src/core/hash.ts` -- counter-based `hash2i` / `hash3i` / `hashString` /
  `rngFromHash`, all uint32 via `Math.imul`. 20 unit tests covering purity,
  order-independence, negative and extreme coordinates, avalanche, and bucket
  spread.
- `src/core/loop.ts` -- fixed-timestep loop, 60Hz sim decoupled from render,
  pausable and single-steppable, sub-step clamped. `advance()` is public and
  rAF-free so it is unit testable. 16 tests.
- `src/core/params.ts` -- URL parameters in and out, with 16 tests including
  round-tripping and malformed-input fallback.
- `src/render/renderer.ts` -- the only module touching `THREE.WebGLRenderer`.
- `src/debug/` -- perf HUD with a line registry, rolling frame timer with spike
  counting, lil-gui panel with a control registry.
- `src/core/camera-rig.ts` -- minimal free-fly camera (see judgement calls).
- Screenshot harness: `shot`, `shots`, `shots:check`, plus `verify:subpath`.
- Five canonical baselines committed in `shots/`.

### Verified

All run on 2026-08-01 in the dev container:

| Check                  | Result                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm test`             | 52 passed, 3 files                                             |
| `npm run build`        | clean `tsc --noEmit`; `dist/` 563.8 kB (142.4 kB gzip)         |
| `npm run shots:check`  | all 5 views byte-identical, run twice, plus once across a source change |
| `npm run verify:subpath` | app ready, zero failed requests, `src="./assets/..."`        |

Live HUD readings at `?seed=hud-check&time=3`, software rendering:

```
fps           60.0
frame ms      16.7 avg / 16.8 max / 0 spikes
draw calls    1
triangles     12
js heap       5.9 MB
chunks        0
worker queue  0
```

Comfortably inside every budget, as it should be with one cube -- the numbers
matter as a starting point to watch, not as an achievement.

### Judgement calls worth knowing about

1. **A free-fly camera was included**, though the roadmap first mentions one in
   Phase 1. Without any way to move, `?pos=` and `?look=` are write-only and the
   panel's copy-link button has nothing to copy, so the Phase 0 URL-repro
   deliverable could not actually be exercised. Kept minimal: WASD/QE, shift to
   sprint, pointer-lock look.

2. **`file://` is not supported, by design.** The acceptance criterion said "the
   deployed static build works from a file path". Chrome blocks ES module
   scripts over `file://` for CORS reasons, and Phase 1's Web Workers hit the
   same wall, so a literal `file://` open cannot work with the fixed stack
   without inlining everything -- which Phase 1 would immediately break.
   Confirmed with the user and implemented as "runs from any static host at any
   nested subpath", enforced by `npm run verify:subpath`.

3. **The screenshot check needed a guard against passing on nothing.** The first
   baseline run produced five byte-identical PNGs and `shots:check` reported
   success -- because the camera was pointing away from the cube and every frame
   was an empty clear colour. A byte comparison cannot tell "stable" from
   "blank". `shots:check` now also fails if a frame has fewer than 4 distinct
   colours, or if all canonical views produce the same image.

4. **The HUD is excluded from canonical screenshots.** It shows fps and heap,
   which can never match between runs. `canonicalizeUrl` forces
   `hud=0&panel=0&freeze=1` on every canonical view. Use `npm run shot -- <url>
   <name> --raw` to capture the HUD while debugging.

5. **`postprocessing` is deliberately not installed.** It belongs to Phase 11.

### Known gaps, deliberately left

- No `src/world/contracts.ts` yet -- Phase 1 owns it.
- The `chunks` and `worker queue` HUD lines are placeholders returning 0. Phase 1
  re-registers the same labels to supply real values; no edit to `app.ts` needed.
- Lighting in `app.ts` is a hemisphere plus a directional light, explicitly
  placeholder. Phase 10 replaces it entirely. Do not build on it.
- The bundle is a single 563 kB chunk. Vite warns about this. Not worth splitting
  until Phase 12 sets an asset budget.

## Phase 1 -- Chunk streaming skeleton (next)

Goal: prove the streaming machinery in isolation, with no terrain, where bugs
are still cheap to find.

- `src/world/contracts.ts`: `ChunkCoord`, `ChunkData`, `ChunkProvider`,
  `TierContext`
- Worker pool (`navigator.hardwareConcurrency - 1`), transferable `ArrayBuffer`
  payloads, priority queue by distance to camera, cancellation for requests that
  fall out of range
- Chunks load and unload by radius around the camera; each renders as a flat
  coloured quad whose colour comes from its coordinate hash
- LRU cache with a hard entry cap; explicit disposal of geometries, materials,
  textures

**Done when:** flying in a straight line for 5 minutes leaves the heap flat and
the chunk count stable, with no pop-in stalls, and returning to origin shows the
same colours it started with.

Starting points that already exist: `rngAt2i` in `src/core/hash.ts` gives a
per-coordinate stream; `hud.register('chunks', ...)` and
`hud.register('worker queue', ...)` replace the placeholders; add canonical views
to `shots/canonical.json` and re-run `npm run shots`.

Re-run the flat-heap test at every subsequent phase. A leak introduced in Phase 6
is far cheaper to find in Phase 6 than in Phase 11.
