# Architecture

Read this and `PROGRESS.md` before writing any code. Update both when done.

## What this is

An infinite, procedurally generated 3D world that runs entirely as a static
browser build. No backend, no server-side generation, no runtime asset fetching
beyond static files.

## Stack (fixed -- do not substitute)

| Concern         | Choice                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language        | TypeScript, strict mode                                     |
| Bundler         | Vite, target `esnext`, `base: './'`, output `/dist`          |
| Renderer        | Three.js, WebGL2, behind a `Renderer` wrapper                |
| Post-processing | `postprocessing` (pmndrs) -- **Phase 11, not yet installed** |
| Generation      | Web Workers -- **Phase 1**; zero generation on the main thread |
| UI              | None. Plain classes and a fixed-timestep loop.               |

No game engine, no React, no state library.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Determinism.** Every piece of world content is a pure function of
   `(worldSeed, coordinate)`. Same seed and coordinate produce byte-identical
   output forever, regardless of visit order or what else is loaded. Use the
   counter-based hashes in `src/core/hash.ts`; never a sequential PRNG whose
   state depends on call order.
2. **No global mutable world state.** Chunks may be unloaded and regenerated at
   any time and must come back identical.
3. **Tiered generation.** Content is generated coarse to fine:
   `Region (4km) -> Sector (512m) -> Chunk (64m)`. A finer tier may read from
   coarser tiers. A coarser tier may **never** read from a finer one. Anything
   spanning chunks -- roads, rivers, settlements -- is decided at the tier that
   fully contains it.
4. **Stable interfaces.** `src/world/contracts.ts` (Phase 1) is load-bearing. If
   a phase requires changing it, stop and explain the change before writing code.
5. **Budgets are hard limits**, checked every phase against the perf HUD:
   60fps at 1080p on integrated graphics; <=1200 draw calls; <=400MB JS heap
   after 5 minutes of continuous movement; <=16ms main-thread frame time with no
   GC spikes above 4ms.

## Key boundaries

### `Renderer` is the graphics API boundary

`src/render/renderer.ts` is the only file permitted to construct or touch
`THREE.WebGLRenderer`. Everything else uses `render()`, `resize()`,
`setWireframe()`, `invalidateMaterials()`, and `stats()`. That keeps a later
WebGPU swap a change to one file, and gives the HUD a single place to read
per-frame draw call and triangle counts from.

Subsystems that add meshes at runtime must call `renderer.invalidateMaterials()`
so wireframe mode reaches the new objects.

### Simulation time is an integer tick, never wall clock

`Loop` accumulates wall time and runs whole `fixedDt` steps (1/60s by default),
clamped to `maxSubSteps` so a slow frame cannot spiral. Simulation time is
always exactly `tick * fixedDt`.

Everything that animates must derive from `simTime`, never from `Date.now()` or
the rAF timestamp. This is what makes `?time=` reproduce an exact world state
and what makes two screenshots of one URL match.

The camera is deliberately *not* part of simulation state: it keeps moving while
the sim is frozen, because freezing exists so you can fly around a paused world
and inspect it.

### Registries, not hardcoded lists

Every subsystem registers its own HUD line and debug toggle rather than being
enumerated in `hud.ts`, `panel.ts`, or `app.ts`:

```ts
hud.register('chunks', () => streamer.loadedCount, HudOrder.world);
panel.folder('Streaming').addToggle('enabled', () => on, (v) => (on = v));
```

`hud.register` replaces by label, so Phase 1 supplies real values for the
placeholder `chunks` and `worker queue` lines without editing `app.ts`.

## Verification

The whole point of Phase 0. Checking later phases should cost nothing but
running a command and looking at a browser.

### Any view is a URL

| Parameter    | Meaning                                        |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `?seed=`     | world seed string; hashed to uint32            |
| `?pos=x,y,z` | camera position                                |
| `?look=`     | `yaw,pitch` in degrees                         |
| `?freeze=1`  | start paused                                   |
| `?time=`     | seek the simulation to an absolute time, in seconds |
| `?hud=0`     | hide the perf HUD                              |
| `?panel=0`   | hide the debug panel                           |
| `?wireframe=1` | start in wireframe                           |

Malformed values fall back to defaults rather than throwing. In the browser,
`__app.currentUrl()` returns a link reproducing exactly what is on screen; the
panel's **copy link to this view** button does the same.

### Screenshots

```
npm run shots         # capture canonical baselines into shots/
npm run shots:check   # re-capture and byte-compare; exits non-zero on any change
npm run shot -- <url> <name> [--raw]
```

Three things make byte-identical comparison possible:

- **The HUD is hidden.** fps and heap can never match between two runs, so
  `canonicalizeUrl` forces `hud=0&panel=0&freeze=1` on every canonical view.
- **The GPU backend is pinned to SwiftShader.** Otherwise a machine with a real
  GPU produces different pixels from a CI container and the committed baselines
  are worthless.
- **Captures wait on `window.__worldReady`, never on a timer.** A sleep-based
  harness starts producing flaky diffs as soon as a phase adds async work.

`shots:check` also guards the two ways a screenshot harness can pass while being
broken: a frame that rendered nothing (measured as distinct-colour count), and
all canonical views collapsing to the same image. Both would otherwise sail
through a byte comparison. This is not hypothetical -- it happened during Phase 0
and the check now catches it.

`--raw` skips canonicalisation so the HUD and panel can be captured while
debugging. Never use a `--raw` shot as a baseline.

### Static subpath

```
npm run verify:subpath
```

`base: './'` means the build runs from any static host at any path depth. This
serves `dist/` from a deliberately nested mount and asserts zero failed requests
plus a rendered frame.

A literal `file://` open cannot work with this stack: Chrome blocks ES module
scripts over `file://` for CORS reasons, and Phase 1's Web Workers hit the same
wall. Serving over HTTP from an arbitrary subpath is the real, durable property.

## Commands

```
npm run dev            # dev server on :5173
npm run build          # tsc --noEmit && vite build
npm run preview        # serve dist/ on :4173
npm test               # vitest
npm run shots          # write screenshot baselines
npm run shots:check    # verify nothing visual changed
npm run verify:subpath # verify the build survives a nested deploy path
```
